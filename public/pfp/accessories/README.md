## PNG accessories

Drop the transparent PNG overlays you shared into this folder.

The app currently expects these filenames (you can rename and I’ll update the library if you prefer):

- `liquidmas-hat.png`
- `cap-liquidated-angle.png`
- `cap-liquidated-angle-2.png`
- `cap-liquidator-angle.png`
- `cap-liquidator-angle-2.png`
- `cap-liquidator-front.png`

Once the files are here, they will appear in the in-app accessory library automatically.
